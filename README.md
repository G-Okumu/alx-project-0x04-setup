# StateCraft: Mastering State Management with Redux & Context API
This project series demonstrates different approaches to state management in React applications by building an interactive counter application. Starting with React’s built-in useState hook, we progressively implement more sophisticated state management solutions including Context API and Redux. The project showcases how to share state across multiple components and maintain application-wide data consistency.

## Learning Objectives
By completing these projects, you will:

1. Understand fundamental React state management using useState
2. Learn to implement global state management with Context API
3. Master Redux for complex state management scenarios
4. Compare different state management solutions
5. Implement state persistence across components
6. Understand the concept of single source of truth
7. Learn to structure applications for scalable state management

## Requirements
### Technical Requirements
- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm or yarn package manager
- React (v18 or later)
- TypeScript
- Next.js framework
- Redux Toolkit (for the Redux implementation)
- React-Redux bindings

### Development Environment
- Code editor (VS Code recommended)
- Terminal/command line access
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, or Edge)

## Best Practices
### General React Practices
- Component Organization: Keep components small and focused
- Type Safety: Utilize TypeScript for type checking
- Separation of Concerns: Separate state management from UI components
- Immutability: Always treat state as immutable
- Single Responsibility: Each component/file should have one primary responsibility
  
## State Management Specific
### Context API:
- Create context providers at the appropriate level in the component tree
- Use custom hooks for context consumption
- Provide proper TypeScript interfaces for context values

### Redux:
- Follow Redux Toolkit’s recommended patterns
- Use slices for modular state management
- Type your Redux store and actions
- Create typed hooks for dispatch and selector usage

### Performance:
- Memoize selectors when necessary
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders with proper state selection
- Consider using Redux middleware for complex side effects
